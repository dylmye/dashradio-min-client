====================
v3.3.0

__** This project is mostly non-functional as it's based on the older Dash Radio base. It was created for research purposes and isn't affiliated with Dash Radio LLC or Skee. Commercial use is prohibited. **__

DR-MC is a basic web app based on Bootstrap and jPlayer which allows access to anyone on nearly any device (read: any browser that supports javascript) to listen to the high-quality, non-commerical streams provided by DJ Skee. This project also makes no money, and gives direct access to the music from every station owned by Dash, without their clunky and desktop-only flash component. This web app makes use of jQuery, HTML and AJAX.
